# TimeTableMatcher

This is a personal project I have made to solve a problem me and my friends had of it being tricky to figure out when everyone is free.

I decided to learn Java Swing and make this app, with a gui so that it would be easy to carry out this task

Directions for use:
click the buttons to set first persons timetable
click next
add in next person.

when done, click next on the last persons one, before clicking compare
Program will output all days and times that everyone is free

Thanks
Gury


Future updates I would like to add:
Some way of storing and retriving timetables
Placing it online for easier use
Update the GUI to look more modern
